'sortStudentsByName(...)' using a wrapper function.

**NOTE:** Do not modify the contents of 'sortStudentByName(...)' for this
exercise.

2.'getStudentByName' should recieve the current list of students, and return a new sorted list of students.

3.Make sure that calling 'getStudentsByName(...)' doesn't have a side-effect of modifying the global 'students' array.

4.The 'studentTest1' and 'studentsTest3' test att the bottom of the exercise should alll print 'true'
